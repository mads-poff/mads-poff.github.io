**Bio**

Video games have been a significant part of my life since I was old enough to use a computer. My passion for the medium has only grown since then and I’ve come to appreciate that games are an unparalleled means of connecting people and sharing experiences. I want to be a part of creating the sort of virtual worlds and systems that allow players to make lifelong friends and memories. I take pride in being relentlessly curious, always experimenting with new ideas, tools, and systems. I’m at my best when working with a motivated team interested in blending the classic mechanics of retro games with the new tech and ideas of the modern day.
