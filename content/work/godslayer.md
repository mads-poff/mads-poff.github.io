### The Sumerian First-Person Slaughterfest inspired by the tradition of retro shooters matched with modern design and aesthetics.

Prototyped from January to May of 2021, Godslayer is the culmination of years of fascination in ancient lore, conspiracy theories, and Quake-like retro shooters.

*“Godslayer blends the action of a first person shooter with the magic of a deep RPG to produce killer gameplay! I really love the theme!“* - Jack Mamais, Co-Founder of Impeller Studios
