<h1>Blood for the Blueprint Gods! (Devlog #1)</h1>
<p><strong>October 28th, 2021</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m officially one week into development on a so-far-unnamed horror-inspired arena shooter and I&rsquo;m having a ton of fun with it. This past Monday, I showcased a (mostly) playable build to classmates who responded with enthusiasm and an instant affection for my comically rigid AI monsters. I more or less stuck to the schedule I assigned myself (to my own surprise, admittedly) but it hasn&rsquo;t exactly been easy.</p>

            <h4>When left to their own devices, bugged AI may begin to... fall in love?</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>In the short term, aspects of the prototype will be judged for final projects in two classes. That means I&rsquo;ve roughly four weeks - less, really - to make a demo worthy of both submission to professors and a place on my tragically empty itch.io profile. After that? Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be finishing it! We&rsquo;ll see. This is game number three on the pile of games I really want to finish, but it&rsquo;s the only solo project of them, so there may yet be hope.</p>
<p>At its core, the game&rsquo;s about being a cultist and slaughtering hordes of monsters to give vital lifeblood to your dark god. I keep finding myself resorting to metaphors of body horror when trying to explain this thing - while thematic given the month, I can only describe my schedule in terms of Frank&rsquo;s resurrection in Hellraiser one more time before somebody calls my psychiatrist. This past week I constructed the skeleton, now I need to connect it to the muscles that will give it strength, and finally all the squishy layers of organs and fat that provide the real substance of the thing. Delightful!</p>

            <h4>I use Trello, but sometimes I do better with absurd metaphors for remembering my schedule than, you know, just checking a calendar like a sane man.</h4>

<p>So I built a skeleton, and it was blissful doing so in UE4. Fortunately, Epic is <del>a benevolent god</del> a generous company and provides engine users with a robust set of blueprints and tools to get most types of 3D games up and running ASAP. We used their First Person Character Controller for Godslayer to great success. Now, I&rsquo;m leveraging their excellent First Person Shooter Template to get my foundation built. As of now, there&rsquo;s lots of running, jumping, slipping-into-the-ghost-dimension-and-running-very-fast, and stabbing (without animation) the hungry Mawlings that try to not-so-gently nom you.</p>
<p>For the sake of class project requirements and my own skill advancement, I&rsquo;m also going to be translating my AI Blueprints to C++. This will be the third project in a year that I&rsquo;ve gone off the deep end as far as AI goes, and with each attempt, the gap between &ldquo;what I want to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rsquo;s actually achievable&rdquo; gets smaller and smaller. I learn a ton from ambitious attempts to do stuff beyond my skill. It&rsquo;s been good for me to make these overscoped catastrophes while I&rsquo;m a student and have the space to fall on my face safely and get back up again. For better or worse, I&rsquo;m just masochistic enough to keep at it despite my degree teaching me more about art history than computer science.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s been buzzing around my skull recently. What&rsquo;s going on this week? Mind-melting AI work aside, I&rsquo;m really excited to be jumping back into level design for the first time in a hot minute. If I&rsquo;m going to make sure this new AI is acting accordingly, I need to be testing it in a proper game environment. A little boxed in forest can only do so much good, after all. And besides, every boomer shooter needs its E1M1.</p>
<p>With that underway, it becomes a matter of iteration, iteration, ITERATION! Lots of experimenting and testing as I figure out how to translate the core gameplay loop from my brain (and various napkins and notebooks) into Unreal - and hopefully something <em>unreal</em>!</p>
