<h1>The Exhausted Optimist's Guide to Restarting (Devlog #0)</h1>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent several months prototyping a retro shooter. It was a ton of fun and I learned so much I think my brain started oozing out of my ears and getting on my keyboard. Still, due to the fast pace of our schedule and the sheer quantity of work needed to achieve our team's ambitious aspirations, I stepped away from that project utterly spent.</p>

<p>It's a cruel and unusual feeling, wanting to dive back into the work you love but being entirely burnt out on it. It's a sensation akin to eating nothing but your favorite food for a week then being unable to stomach it for months after. You take a little nibble, start making just one prototype, and suddenly it all comes back up. Needless to say, that sucks. A LOT. So with plans for another FPS on the horizon, how was I going to make sure I could stomach it?</p>

<p>I took the first steps into this somewhat unintentionally. For a couple of months, while classwork took me in a totally unrelated direction, I dabbled in a myriad of small experiments I'd otherwise not had time for. The copy of PICO-8 I'd barely touched became the catalyst for a barebones but heartfelt exploration of roguelike mechanics. Learning GDScript for Godot helped keep me at a slower, more manageable pace when I was struck by inspiration for a Doom-like shooter prototype.</p>

<p>If anything, the fact that none of these have made it past their early days of learning and experimenting has probably been the best part. By testing the waters, I was getting my feet wet again without thinking about trying to pressure myself into jumping into the deep end. Embracing the drive to make games without tying it to a grade or money was critical for getting the mental gears turning again. Without those sort of "side quests", it'd be significantly harder to approach starting a big project again.</p>

<br></br>

<p>Another essential component was the myriad of excellent retro shooters I finally had time to explore in earnest. Dusk earned some additional hours on my Steam account from a sorely-needed revisit. I found great joy in HROT, the authentically retro Soviet shooter written in Pascal by a solo dev with a sincere appreciation for the color brown. When the Quake remaster dropped, I was warmed by the hype fans reacted with. "Boomer shooters" aren't just for boomers - turns out plenty of folks still get a kick out of some low-res fragging. I'd be making this stuff even if the rest of the world moved on (that's usually how obsession works I suppose), but it's still pretty rad to see everybody having a great time with it.</p>

<p>As with most tasks, simply starting is often the hardest part. It's the baby steps taken in laying the foundation that help things feel "official". Everything from setting up a GitHub repo to outlining a GDD pays dividends when it comes to motivation.

<br></br>
<p>I'm a firm believer in the fact that it's a miracle any video game gets made. As I've come to learn, stubborn passion isn't always enough to see you through. It takes a healthy mix of outside inspiration, the occasional detour, and a whole lot of slowly crawling in the right direction until you're able to get up and walk again.</p>
