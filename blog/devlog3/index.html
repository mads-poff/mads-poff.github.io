<h1>Sick Tips to Read While Sick in Bed (Devlog #3)</h1>
<p><em>Jan 21, 2021</em></p>
<p><strong>404: HEALTH NOT FOUND</strong></p>
<p>Hey y&rsquo;all! Thanks for stopping by. I&rsquo;m sorry to report that there&rsquo;s been no progress on Sinister Santa this week (which I can promise is infinitely more frustrating to me than you). My partner and I caught some kind of nasty cold around Monday and found out Wednesday our household is almost assuredly Covid-positive (thankfully everyone&rsquo;s double vaxxed and asymptomatic so far). I don&rsquo;t like to complain much when I get sick, as I&rsquo;m extremely fortunate that it&rsquo;s a rare occurrence and usually not all that bad, but this week was pretty miserable for our whole household. With any luck however, the worst should be behind us, and I can get back to my usual pace over the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>UE4 BRILLIANCE FROM TWITTER</strong></p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been too out of it to have an original train of thought this week, please enjoy this small pile of cool tips and tricks I&rsquo;ve come across in my doomscrolling. If you like this stuff, definitely give these fine folks a follow, and follow me if you want your timeline filled with retweets of similar content.</p>
<p>First up, a fantastic idea from Joe on how to make mechanical tweaks easier for the designers and other non-programmers on the team (or just save yourself from touching your own weeks-old spaghetti):</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joewintergreen/status/1480781360893554688?t=BZaV9LuNmc2-NV_3Zsi1ZQ&amp;s=19">https://twitter.com/joewintergreen/status/1480781360893554688?t=BZaV9LuNmc2-NV_3Zsi1ZQ&amp;s=19</a></p>
<p>Unreal Directive saved me a good bit of headache by reminding us that Select nodes are a thing. I was working on the Naughty List (high score board) in Sinister Santa on Sunday and actually trying to remember this exact node but kept drawing a blank. I knew it started with an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, but Sequence and Switch nodes weren&rsquo;t it. I felt pretty silly (though relieved) after seeing this:</p>

<p>Finally, Let&rsquo;s Make FX shared a simple but effective setup for generating noise in materials. I&rsquo;d just grabbed one of the default noise textures included with the engine for the light noise on the snow texture, but I&rsquo;d like to go back and play around with this instead, time permitting:</p>

<p><strong>UPCOMING DYING MMO JAM</strong></p>
<p>I want to give a shoutout to what might be the coolest game jam idea I&rsquo;ve seen in a while. Salem of Fortresses (@duck_bubbles) is hosting the Dying MMO Jam on Itch.io from February 3rd to 20th. It&rsquo;s a really intriguing concept with a very permissive ruleset. I plan on giving it a go (even with my abysmal track record of actually finishing game jams) and I&rsquo;d love to see more folks sign up. Otherwise, keep an eye out for all the games that come out of this and the devs some love.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough rambling for this week. I&rsquo;m off to down a bunch of tea and cold meds. At least I&rsquo;m bound to appreciate being able to breathe through my nose and look at a screen headache-free significantly more when I do get to working on the game again over the next week. Stay safe out there, play some cool games (and tell me about them if you do, I love finding out about new games!) and stay weird!</p>
