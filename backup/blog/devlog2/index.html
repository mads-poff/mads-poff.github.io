<h1>Sinister Santa and the road ahead (Devlog #2)</h1>

<p>Hey nerds. First off, some fun news - I&rsquo;ve graduated college! This previous fall marked my last quarter at Savannah College of Art and Design. The past four-ish years have been an absolute blast. In getting a game design degree, I had the chance to work with so many fantastic peers and professors in creating a number of challenging, fun projects. I also got to dabble in a few other areas from creative writing to astronomy, picking up some additional interesting knowledge and experiences along the way.</p>
<p>Graduating is truly a bittersweet feeling. I&rsquo;m extremely excited to be moving on to start my career in earnest, though I will miss the freedom and familiarity of student life. But as the Shire&rsquo;s best poet once say, the road goes ever on and on, and I must follow if I can!</p>
<p>If your team&rsquo;s looking for a System Designer to work on conjuring up cool stuff in Unreal Engine, let me know! I&rsquo;m on the hunt for a full time position and would love for us to strike up a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>SINISTER SANTA</strong></p>

<p>The holidays gifted me with inspiration for a side project I&rsquo;ve been working on a few weeks now - Sinister Santa, the unsettling answer to the never-before-asked question of &ldquo;what would you do if the big man in red wanted you dead?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a short, whimsical shoot-&lsquo;em-up with arcade-like mechanics and a creepy Christmas coating. From the confines of your snow fort, defend yourself from the oncoming horde of elves, reindeer, and snowmen that Santa&rsquo;s sent to annihilate you. Stick it out long enough to duel St. Nick himself and earn your place on the naughty list for good!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m onto the final stages of testing and polish and aim to have the game out within the week*. It&rsquo;ll be free (with optional donation if you&rsquo;re still in a giving spirit) on Itch.io, so follow me there to be the first to know as soon as it&rsquo;s out. I&rsquo;ve had a ton of fun making this and am looking forward to y&rsquo;all playing this with all the excitement of a kid waiting for Christmas morning!</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m optimistic about this, but I&rsquo;ve already been quite delayed on this due to, well, <em>&lt;gestures broadly at the world around him&gt;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>LET&rsquo;S MAKE SOME GAMES</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for bearing with me over the holiday hiatus! Life&rsquo;s a bit weird at the moment while I figure out a job, future living situation, and wrap up Sinister Santa, but I should settle into a proper routine sooner or later. Moving forward, the goal is to post a weekly devlog about my main project(s) and more specific articles whenever I have something interesting to ramble about. Follow me on Twitter (@mvpgamedev) for more consistent posts (both serious and silly) and definitely reach out if you want to work on something together - mpoff99 (at) gmail (dot) com for email, and I&rsquo;m happy to give you my Discord if you ask. Enjoy the new year, keep safe, play some cool games, and, most critically, stay weird!</p>
